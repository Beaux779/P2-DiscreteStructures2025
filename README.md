# P2 – Discrete Structures 2025

## Project Overview
This program demonstrates set operations as part of a discrete mathematics assignment.  
The program:
- Reads two sets from input files  
- Prints their **Cartesian product**  
- Prints all **subsets** of the first set  
- Computes and prints their **intersection**  
- Writes all results to an output file  

---

## Files
- `p02.cpp` – Main driver program  
- `Set.h` – Class definition for the set  
- `Set.cpp` – Implementation of the `Set` class  
- `p02make` – Makefile to compile the project  
- `input1.dat` – Example input file for Set A  
- `input2.dat` – Example input file for Set B  
- `output.dat` – Example program output file  
- `p02.exe` – Precompiled executable (Windows)  

---

## Compilation
### Using `make`
```bash
make -f p02make
